# Digital Logic and VHDL Projects

This collection of projects demonstrates competence in **Digital Logic** and **Hardware Design** using the **Hardware Description Language (HDL)** **VHDL**.

The projects were developed in the context of Computer Architecture or Digital Logic courses, focusing on the implementation of digital circuits for simulation in tools like Xilinx ISE.

## Demonstrated Concepts

*   **VHDL:** Knowledge of VHDL syntax and semantics for describing digital circuits.
*   **Digital Logic:** Implementation of logic components, such as counters, decoders, and finite state machines.
*   **Simulation and Testing:** Use of _Test Benches_ (`TBproj1.vhd`, `TBproj2.vhd`, `FFD_TB.vhd`) to verify the behavior of the described hardware.
*   **Hardware Synthesis:** Familiarity with the design flow for synthesis on FPGAs (implied by the use of Xilinx ISE project files).

## Included Projects

| Project | Main Files | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Counter/Stopwatch** | `cron_decr.vhd` | Implementation of a digital counter or stopwatch in VHDL. |
| **Sequential Logic** | `proj2.vhd` | Implementation of a sequential logic circuit (possibly a register or counter). |
| **D Flip-Flop** | `FFD_TB.vhd` | Test Bench for a D Flip-Flop, a fundamental component of sequential logic. |
| **Other Components** | `debounce.vhd` | Module for _debouncing_ (noise elimination) of input signals. |

## How to View and Analyze

The `.vhd` files are the hardware source code. For simulation and synthesis, **Xilinx ISE** software or similar tools are required.

**Recommendation for Recruiters:** The VHDL code itself is the evidence of the skill. Analysis of the `.vhd` files and the _Test Benches_ demonstrates the ability to design and verify digital circuits.

**Language:** VHDL **Topics:** Digital Logic, VHDL, Hardware Design, Digital Systems, FPGA.
